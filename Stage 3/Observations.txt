In the last Stage3 I have choosen to create some simple Face Detection algo Lips detection.

For the purpose of this analysis we have used several layers to extacrt facial features and as we have seen 
the later layer we use the more centered are our results. So I wanted to capitalize on that point and in the same time
to demonstrate that even simple algo as we have can capture specific part of face in decent way. This is generally the rule
in Data Science and I believe in many industries "Choose simplest thing that works"))).

So basically what I have done I blurred images first in accordance with the best found average filter (Gaussian 5) and 
run Layer3 to capture lips of a person. After that I applied edge detection algo to capture the edges of lips in
visually more perceptive way.


Thank you))
