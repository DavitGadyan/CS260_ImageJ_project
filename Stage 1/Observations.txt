After trying out various filters and kernel sizes we identified that most probably the best solution is to use Gaussian
Blur filter with kernel size of 5. From 4 images we had 164,165,166 seem to follow Standard Behavior pattern we defined,
while 167 from the first layer L0 picked up all face pixels and in L1 face edge pixels in L2 just mounth as well in L3 i.e. last layer.

The reason can be that picture 167 has specific darker face coloring compared to previous faces and that may be the reason. 
Later we will try to match this image to the benchmark we define from 3 previous images. 

For now in Stage 1 we will further try to optimize Gaussian Blur filter size 5 * 5 by assigning various 'normally-distributed'
weights and see what happens using ImageJ Convolve specific tool where we can specify our kernel values.
